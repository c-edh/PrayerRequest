# Prayer Request 
Developer: **Corey Edh**

## About this app
This App is about asking for prayer request, and praying for others. Your account is through **Apple Sign In**, to allow people to keep their personal data to themselves.


## Why Make this App?

Still working on its title, project name is "God is Love" from a verse 1 John 4:8. 

Why did I choose to do a prayer app, I choose to do a prayer app because I notice a lot of prayer apps are outdated and I decided it would be a fun challenge to test my skillset
